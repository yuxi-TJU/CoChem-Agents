# CoChem-Agents
CoChem Agents use Gemini CLI as the general-purpose agent shell and plug in domain tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Anyone can contribute an MCP server—RDKit, Materials Project, your internal pipeline—and it becomes instantly usable by the same agent. This creates an open, extensible ecosystem for Chemistry and Material AI Agent.
