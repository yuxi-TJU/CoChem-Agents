# Synthesis Planning - 合成规划

Design optimal synthesis routes using retrosynthetic analysis and forward planning:

## Retrosynthetic Analysis

1. **Target Structure Analysis**
   - Identify key bonds to disconnect
   - Recognize common synthons
   - Consider stereochemistry
   - Note functional group compatibility

2. **Disconnection Strategy**
   - Apply standard disconnections (C-C, C-N, C-O bonds)
   - Use named reaction patterns
   - Consider convergent vs linear routes
   - Evaluate complexity reduction

3. **Starting Material Selection**
   - Check commercial availability
   - Consider cost and lead time
   - Evaluate handling requirements
   - Assess atom economy

## Forward Synthesis Planning

### Route Design
For each proposed route:
1. **Step-by-step reactions** with conditions
2. **Reagent selection** with alternatives
3. **Yield estimates** based on literature
4. **Purification strategy** for each step
5. **Scale-up considerations**

### Reaction Conditions
Specify for each step:
- Temperature and pressure
- Solvent system
- Catalysts/reagents (equiv.)
- Reaction time
- Workup procedure
- Expected byproducts

### Green Chemistry Evaluation
- E-factor calculation
- Atom economy
- Solvent selection (green alternatives)
- Energy efficiency
- Waste minimization

## Alternative Routes

Provide at least 2-3 synthetic routes:
- **Route A**: Most practical (proven conditions)
- **Route B**: Most elegant (fewer steps)
- **Route C**: Most sustainable (green chemistry)

## Risk Assessment

Identify potential issues:
- Difficult transformations
- Hazardous reagents
- Unstable intermediates
- Purification challenges
- Scale-up limitations

## Cost Analysis

Estimate for 1g, 100g, and 1kg scale:
- Raw material costs
- Reagent/catalyst costs
- Solvent and consumables
- Labor time estimate
- Total cost per gram

## Literature Precedent

Cite relevant examples:
- Similar transformations
- Key reaction references
- Review articles
- Named reaction sources

**Prioritize safety, practicality, and sustainability in route selection.**
