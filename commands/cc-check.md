# Comprehensive Chemical Check - 全面化学检查

Perform comprehensive checks based on the specified type:

## Check Types

### Safety Check
Evaluate chemical safety:
- **GHS Classification**: Pictograms, signal words, hazard statements
- **Physical Hazards**: Explosive, flammable, oxidizing, reactive
- **Health Hazards**: Toxicity, corrosivity, carcinogenicity, mutagenicity
- **Environmental Impact**: Persistence, bioaccumulation, aquatic toxicity
- **Handling Requirements**: PPE, storage, disposal, emergency procedures

### Patent Check
Analyze intellectual property:
- Search USPTO, EPO, and Google Patents
- Check for composition of matter patents
- Review method of use patents
- Assess freedom to operate
- Identify key patent holders
- Note expiration dates

### Quality Check
Assess molecular quality:
- Drug-likeness (Lipinski, Veber, QED)
- Structural alerts (PAINS, Brenk, ALARM)
- Synthetic accessibility
- Metabolic stability predictions
- Lead-likeness for early discovery

### Regulatory Check
Verify compliance status:
- Controlled substances (DEA schedules)
- Chemical weapons convention
- Precursor chemicals
- Import/export restrictions
- REACH registration (EU)
- TSCA status (US)
- Regional restrictions

## Analysis Approach

1. **Gather Data**: Collect relevant information from databases
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate severity and likelihood
3. **Compliance Check**: Verify against regulations
4. **Generate Recommendations**: Provide actionable advice
5. **Document Findings**: Create audit trail

## Report Format

### Executive Summary
- Overall risk level: 🟢 Low | 🟡 Moderate | 🔴 High | ⚫ Extreme
- Key findings (bullet points)
- Critical actions required

### Detailed Findings
- Category-by-category analysis
- Supporting evidence
- Regulatory citations

### Recommendations
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Alternative suggestions
- Best practices
- Required documentation

**Always err on the side of caution and recommend consulting specialists for high-risk compounds.**
